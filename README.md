# AR Nutrition Scanner

**AR Nutrition Scanner** is an Android app that helps you check the nutrition of your food by scanning barcodes and showing the info using **augmented reality (AR)**.  

It uses the [OpenFoodFacts API](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) to get nutrition data, so you can quickly see what’s in your food without reading tiny labels.

## Features

- **Nutri‑Score:** A simple way to check the overall nutrition of a product.  
- **Food Composition:** Shows calories, protein, fat, sugar, salt, and more.  
- **Processing & CO₂ Score:** Lets you know how processed a product is and gives an estimate of its environmental impact.  
- **AR Overlay:** Nutrition info appears right on top of the scanned product.  
- **Barcode Scanning:** Works with almost any packaged food.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Unity** – for building the app and AR experience.  
- **AR Foundation / ARCore** – for augmented reality features.  
- **OpenFoodFacts API** – provides food data.  
- **C#** – for the app logic.

## How It Works

1. Open the app and point your camera at a food product.  
2. Scan the barcode, which fetches data from OpenFoodFacts.  
3. The app shows Nutri‑Score, processing and CO₂ info, and the full nutrition breakdown in AR.  
4. You can tap on the AR overlay to see more details about the food.

## Why It’s Useful

- Makes it easier to check what’s in your food.  
- Gives a quick sense of how processed a product is.
